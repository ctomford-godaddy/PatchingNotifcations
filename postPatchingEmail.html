<p><strong>What:</strong>&nbsp; The SRE-GPD<span style="color:#d4d4d4"> </span>team has finished <span style="color:black !important">patching</span> your servers. (Please see the list below for a list of affected systems.)</p>

<p><strong>What we need from you:</strong>&nbsp; All servers must pass QA (pass user acceptance testing) by the application owner before any additional deployments or being returned to service.&nbsp; <strong><u>This validation must be performed within 18 hours of the receipt of this message.</u> </strong>&nbsp; Once your validation is complete, add the systems into service. (For A/B clusters, this means swinging the cluster to C)</p>
